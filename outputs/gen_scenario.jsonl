{"name": "Rover", "description": "Rover is a pet-sitting and dog-walking marketplace that connects pet owners with vetted caregivers. Users create and manage profiles (owners, sitters), pet records (species, breed, age, vaccines, behavior notes, emergency contacts), and service listings (walks, drop-ins, boarding, daycare) with pricing, availability calendars, service areas, and house rules. Owners can search by location and dates, request bookings, message sitters, and confirm reservations. The platform manages booking lifecycles (requested, accepted, in-progress, completed, canceled), check-in/out events, visit reports (photos metadata, potty/meal notes), and payment flows (pre-authorizations, payouts, fees, refunds). Sitters manage schedules, capacity, repeat clients, and automated reminders. Both sides can handle reviews/ratings, disputes, and support tickets. Admin workflows include sitter onboarding status, background-check flags, promo codes, and policy enforcement. All core data—users, pets, services, bookings, messages, transactions, reviews, and availability—can be synthesized realistically for API simulation."}
{"name": "GoFundMe", "description": "GoFundMe is a crowdfunding and donations platform where organizers run fundraising campaigns and donors contribute. Organizers can create and manage campaigns (title, goal amount, category, beneficiary, location, images metadata), post updates, configure withdrawal settings, and track donations and comments. Donors can search/browse campaigns by category and location, donate one-time or recurring, leave short messages, opt into anonymity, and download donation receipts. Key entities include campaigns, organizers, beneficiaries, donors, donations, recurring pledges, comments, updates, payouts, bank accounts, and verification documents (metadata/status). Workflows include campaign creation and review, donation checkout, fraud/risk checks (status flags), donor receipt generation, organizer withdrawal requests, payout processing, and refund handling. APIs can support CRUD for campaigns, updates, donation intents, pledge schedules, and payout events; plus webhooks for payment succeeded/failed, chargebacks, and payout sent. The platform is highly synthesizable via amounts, donor profiles, campaign progress, statuses, timestamps, and audit trails."}
{"name": "DocuSign (E-Signature & Agreement Workflow)", "description": "DocuSign is a digital agreement platform that manages document templates and signature workflows. Users create envelopes (agreement packages), upload documents, define recipients and roles (signer, approver, CC), and place fields (signature, initials, dates, text inputs, checkboxes). Workflows include sending for signature, reminders, recipient authentication settings, signing order, expiration, and status tracking (created, sent, delivered, signed, completed, declined, voided). Admins manage templates, reusable fields, branding, user groups, and permission sets. The platform maintains an audit trail of events (viewed, signed, IP address, timestamps), and supports webhooks (connect events) for downstream systems. APIs can simulate envelope creation, recipient routing, and state transitions without needing real document content—metadata, field definitions, and completion artifacts (signed status, certificate IDs) are sufficient for realistic testing. Database interactions are rich: envelope records link to documents, recipients, tabs/fields, reminders, and event logs, enabling reproducible end-to-end CRUD scenarios."}
{"name": "Samsara (Fleet & Asset Maintenance Management)", "description": "Samsara is a connected-operations platform for fleet management and equipment tracking. Core entities include vehicles/assets, drivers, routes, trips, GPS points, maintenance schedules, inspection reports, and alerts. Managers assign drivers to vehicles, define geofences, configure thresholds (speeding, idling), and review trip summaries with start/end times, distances, and event counts. Maintenance workflows include creating work orders, logging odometer/engine hours, scheduling preventive maintenance, tracking parts, and closing repairs with costs and vendor details. Driver workflows include daily vehicle inspections (DVIR), issue reporting with severity, and acknowledgment/repair verification. While real GPS is live in production, simulation can generate realistic coordinates, trip traces, and sensor readings (fuel level, engine temp) along with alert events and statuses. The scenario is ideal for API testing because it involves time-series records plus CRUD on assets, assignments, and maintenance tickets, enabling deterministic replay of trips, alerts, and work-order lifecycles."}
{"name": "Fortnite Item Shop", "description": "Fortnite’s Item Shop (as a standalone virtual goods storefront simulation) focuses on rotating offers, purchases, and entitlement management rather than gameplay. Core entities include users, cosmetics (skins, emotes, wraps), bundles, shop rotations, offers, pricing rules, currencies (V-Bucks), wallets, purchase receipts, refunds/tokens, inventories/entitlements, gifting transactions, wishlists, and parental controls. Administrators can create cosmetic items, define rarity and categories, attach images/metadata, build bundles, schedule shop rotations by region/time, and set pricing/discount rules. Users can browse current offers, filter by category, preview items (metadata), purchase with stored currency, gift items to friends, and view receipts and inventory. Refund workflows can be modeled with limited refund tokens, eligibility checks, and reversal of entitlements and wallet balances. Compliance workflows include age gating, spending limits, and fraud flags. Reporting can include revenue by item, conversion rates by rotation, and refund rates. Everything is cleanly synthesizable: item catalogs, schedules, wallets, and transaction ledgers can be generated realistically and exercised through CRUD-heavy APIs."}
{"name": "Etsy Digital Downloads", "description": "Etsy Digital Downloads (modeled as a marketplace for downloadable templates and digital goods) is suitable for CRUD-heavy interactions without producing long-form content. Entities include sellers, shops, product listings, digital files (metadata only), variations, inventory rules (for limited-license items), orders, payments, fees, coupons, messages, reviews/ratings, refunds, and tax settings. Sellers can create and manage listings with titles, categories, tags, pricing, licensing options, and file attachments; set sales and coupons; and manage shop policies and shipping settings (often “digital delivery”). Buyers can search/browse categories, favorite items/shops, add items to cart, check out, download purchased files (simulated), request help/refunds, and leave ratings with short reviews. Workflow simulation includes order fulfillment status (auto-delivered vs manual), dispute handling, partial refunds, and messaging threads between buyer and seller. Admin workflows include content policy enforcement, listing takedowns, and seller verification status. Analytics can be synthesized for shop visits, conversion, revenue, and top listings. The core value is commerce and order management, making it ideal for database-driven API environments."}
{"name": "DoorDash Drive (Delivery Tracking)", "description": "DoorDash Drive-style logistics focuses on dispatching and tracking deliveries for merchants without needing restaurant discovery content. Entities include merchants, locations, menus (optional metadata), delivery orders, items, pickup/dropoff addresses, delivery windows, drivers/dashers, assignments, status events, proof-of-delivery, tips, payouts, cancellations, refunds, and customer support cases. Merchants can create deliveries manually or via API, specify item lists and special instructions, schedule pickups, and choose service levels. Dispatch workflows include batching orders, assigning/unassigning drivers, re-routing, and handling exceptions (store closed, customer unreachable). Tracking workflows store a timeline of states (created, confirmed, dasher assigned, picked up, en route, delivered) plus GPS pings and ETA updates (synthesized). Proof-of-delivery can be modeled with signatures, photos (metadata), and delivery notes. Financial workflows include calculating delivery fees, tips, promotions, dasher payouts, and issuing refunds or adjustments. Customer service workflows include chat/ticket creation, escalation, and resolution codes. This environment provides rich CRUD interactions and realistic event-driven tracking data ideal for API simulation."}
{"name": "SurveyMonkey Apply", "description": "SurveyMonkey Apply is an application and registration management platform used for grants, scholarships, events, and programs.

Administrators can create programs and cycles, design multi-step applications, configure eligibility screening, set deadlines, and define required uploads. Applicant workflows include account creation, saving drafts, submitting applications, uploading documents, and responding to follow-up requests. Review workflows include assigning applications to reviewers, collecting scores with rubrics, tracking conflicts of interest, and moving submissions through stages (submitted, in review, shortlisted, interview, approved/declined). Communication workflows include automated emails, reminders, and status change notifications. Decision workflows include generating award offers, collecting accept/decline responses, and exporting recipient lists for downstream systems. Audit logs and permissions support compliance. This scenario is ideal for synthesis because it is dominated by structured records, status transitions, and role-based CRUD across forms, submissions, and evaluations."}
